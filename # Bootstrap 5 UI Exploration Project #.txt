## Project Reflection

### How I Built the Project
I started by studying Bootstrap 5 documentation and example pages to understand 
component structure and layout patterns. I then extracted reusable UI components 
and rebuilt them to create original pages. Bootstrap utility classes were used 
to maintain spacing, alignment, and responsiveness across all pages.

### Tools and Resources Used
- Bootstrap official documentation
- GitHub for version control and hosting
- ChatGPT for guidance and understanding concepts

### Challenges Faced
- Maintaining consistent layout across pages  
- Ensuring responsiveness on different screen sizes  

### How I Solved Them
- Reused common components like navbar and footer  
- Used Bootstrap grid system and utility classes effectively  

### Learning Outcome
This project helped me understand how to remix Bootstrap components creatively, 
improve UI/UX sense, and build responsive web pages following professional standards.

### Time Taken
Approximately 6–8 hours
